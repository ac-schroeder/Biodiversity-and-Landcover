    "# Introduction <a id='Introduction'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Biodiversity loss is one of the most urgent issues the planet is facing. It has been proposed that our planet should dedicate approximately half of its land area to remain wild, in order for the ecosystem of the world to survive.[[1]], [[2]] A deterioration in biodiversity will have knock-on effects on all aspects of life for humans, from weather patterns, to desertification and erosion, to the health of crops and pollinators, to fish stocks, further global warming, and more.[[3]]\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between expanding human development and the pressures on wildlife is undergoing rapid research and study. It is widely understood that reduction of areas for natural ecosystems exerts pressures on species populations and is one of the leading causes of their decline.[[4]] Data is being gathered on species counts, and attempts to quantify human expansion and impact are underway.[[5]] One measure of this is land cover, which is based on satellite imaging. It is used to calculate the ratios of countries' area that are natural, such as wetland and forest, and which are human-developed, such as cropland and urban surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "This report will investigate whether existing data on species counts and land cover ratios show any clear correlation between the health of a country's wildlife, and its reservation of natural land which is not developed by humans. It will look at several statistical measures of species endangerment, as well as natural and non-natural land cover ratios and designation of protected land, among a sample set of countries, to see if any patterns are evident.\n",

    "## Project Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "As the topic is very large, this project will focus on four statistics and their relationship to one another. These statistics are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the percentage of threatened species in a country\n",
    "- the Red List Index for a country\n",
    "- the land cover class ratios of a country\n",
    "- the percentage cover of protected land of a country\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will take an exploratory approach towards the datasets containing these statistics. It will consider the same sample set of countries for each one. It will explore and create visualisations for them, showing the ranges of values and how the different countries perform, before looking at the relationships between the statistics to see if any patterns or correlations exist. \n",
    "\n",
    "After Exploratory Data Analysis, the specific research questions this report seeks to address are: \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Q1: Do the countries with the highest percentages of threatened species have the least percentage of natural land cover?**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Q2: Is there any relationship between growth of human developed land and rise in species endangerment rates over recent decades?**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> **Q3: And, if such a correlation cannot be determined, is designation of protected areas within a country a better indicator for improved species endangerment rates?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will utilise several datasets which have been collected by the [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)](https://www.oecd.org/about/) and the [International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)](https://www.iucn.org/about). These datasets are in the form of CSV files, which will need to be read and processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IUCN assesses and categorizes risk bands for species, which are Least Concern, Vulnerable, Endangered, Critically Endangered, and Extinct. The IUCN also maintains the [Red List](https://www.iucnredlist.org/about/background-history), which is a list of globally threatened species, and the [Red List Index](https://www.iucnredlist.org/assessment/red-list-index), a score applied to countries and the world which measures changes from year to year in the weighted, aggregated status of the species of the region.[[6]]\n",
    "\n",
    "The OECD collects data from nations, the UN, and NGOs on a variety of economic issues. It also has an extensive collection of datasets on environmental issues. It maintains a large online statistical database, https://stats.oecd.org/. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project will use the following datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Threatened Species](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=WILD_LIFE) (OECD): A dataset of threatened species numbers from the latest year's responses from countries in response to the OECD's Annual Quality Assurance of OECD environmental reference series, harmonised by the OECD Working Party on Environmental Information (WPEI). Countries supply their own numbers of counts of threatened species in various IUCN categories, although they may also supply their own national classifications, or even IUCN Red List data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Red List Index](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=RED_LIST) (OECD from UNDESA, IUCN): A measure of the change in aggregate extinction risk across species for each country, extracted from the UNDESA database. The Red List Index is compiled and assessed at the global level by the IUCN and Bird Life International.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Land Cover](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=LAND_COVER) (OECD from ESA): A breakdown of percentages and square kilometers of countries by land cover class, such as tree cover or cropland. Data is sourced by the OECD from satellite imagery collected and processed by Copernicus/European Space Agency and Universit√© catholique de Louvain [Geomatics Climate Change Initiative](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-land-cover)\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Protected Areas](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=PROTECTED_AREAS) (OECD from UNEP-WCMC, IUCN): A dataset of percentage of total country area that is designated protected land on the national level. Calculated from the [World Database on Protected Areas](https://www.iucn.org/theme/protected-areas/our-work/world-database-protected-areas), a joint project between the United Nations Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) and the IUCN. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications of the Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the Threatened Species dataset and the Red List Index dataset measure rates of species endangerment. They are both included in this study because they are gathered and calculated in different ways, and thus can be used to supplement and verify one another. Additionally, only the Red List Index contains historical data, which can be used to look at trends in countries over the last two decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Land Cover and Protected Areas datasets are two very different approaches to measuring human land use and what proportions of a country's land mass may potentially be wild. Land cover is considered by the OECD to be a useful metric for assessing pressures on wildlife.[[7]] Both have caveats, in that neither measure truly guarantees that land labeled as \"natural\" or \"protected\" is intact wild land, unhindered by humans. These caveats will be explored further throughout this report. However, the datasets are valuable data for gaining insight into the pressures on biodiversity. \n",

    "## Project Background and Approach\n",
    " \n",
    "### Project Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the limited nature of this project, it is beyond its scope to do a thorough scientific investigation of the issues being explored, or draw any scientifically sound conclusions. The main aim of this project is to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis and to implement Python and its libraries to visualise data in meaningful ways, with some insights drawn. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project will examine the identified statistics in the above datasets over a sample set of countries, and make a few simple comparison plots between them with the sample set, to check for patterns. Use of the full population data, investigation of outliers, or investigation of follow-up questions will be beyond the scope of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a possible direction of further research is included at the end of this report.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Sample Set\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will use a limited number of countries as a sample set across all datasets and sections of this report. The sample set used will be gleaned from the smallest of the datasets being used, which is the Threatened Species database. This set will be used for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As it is the set of countries in the Threatened Species database, all statistics in this study can therefore be included for all the countries in the study.\n",
    "2. By using a sample set of countries rather than a very large set or all countries, it is possible to identify and keep track of individual countries throughout, while maintaining the ability to create meaningful visualisations that are not overly crowded. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the subject matter deals with a genuinely critical global issue, and geography and politics have massive influence over the situation in each country, this project opts to maintain the ability to identify which data belongs to which country (in other words, no anonymisation), as it enables further research and investigation into the factors that might cause unique circumstances in each country, particularly where outliers or other interesting findings are discovered.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, meaningful visualisations for large sample sets become difficult, as too many records become difficult to plot against a legend or key, and still remain readable. The sample set here is 37 countries. It is already quite large, so visualisations will need to be chosen with care. This project will use lattice grids, aggregations of data, and carefully drawn bar plots in order to make the data visualisations readable. If the sample set were much larger, even this would become impossible, and the data would need to be anonymised.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Process and Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will take the following structural approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "***I. [Introduction to the Project](#Introduction)***\n",
    "    \n",
    "Here the project aims and background are explained, the datasets are introduced, and any anticipated limitations are laid out. There is also a discussion of any ethical concerns or issues with the data or conclusions of this project. \n",
    "    \n",
    "***II. [Exploratory Data Analysis of each Dataset](#EDA)***\n",
    "\n",
    "All four datasets are given an Exploratory Data Analysis. Each dataset is individually introduced, its limitations evaluated, and applications to the research explained. The data is then refined to the sample set and the relevant statistics before being explored. In exploration, it is checked for completeness of records and that values are within expected ranges. The data is then restructured so that it can be used to produce visualisations that demonstrate the focused statistic comparatively between countries. Any needed aggregations are calculated, and then the data is visualised in one or more plots or lattice plots, to give an overview of the relevant statistic across the sample set.\n",
    "    \n",
    "***III. [Analysis of Research Questions](#Research-Analysis)***\n",
    "\n",
    "The research questions are reviewed and examined one by one. The datasets are merged together into new dataframes in order to produce plots that show the statistics comparatively against each other, typically in scatterplots, in order to answer the research questions. Patterns or correlations in the data are identified. Each question is concluded with observations and discussion of limitations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "***IV. [Conclusion and Critical Evaluation](#Conclusions)***\n",
    "\n",
    "This includes a final assessment of the results of the study, along with discussion of the merits of the study and any flaws in its premise, usage of the data, or choices made in the study approach.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation of Project Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "The research questions are open questions as to whether correlations or patterns in the data exist. Data visualisations that plot the relevant statistics against each other, such as scatterplots, will be used, and then assessed for evidence of correlation or pattern, such as clustering, particularly along a line that would indicate either positive or negative correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study employs multiple datasets for each type of statistic (species endangerment, land cover), and these can be used to cross-check and verify one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting observations will be followed by a discussion of the limitations of the data and the method of their comparison, to qualify any observed patterns, or lack thereof.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations of the Study  \n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets have a number of limitations which are discussed in detail in their respective sections of Exploratory Data Analysis. For instance, some statistics have problems with completeness of data collection, or consistency between countries in data collection method. These are detailed in their respective sections, and in at least one case they have led to preference for one dataset over another. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are, however, additionally some anticipated limitations on the application of the data to the research questions, which should serve as caveats to any results of this study:\n",
    "\n",
    "***The pressures on wildlife populations are complex and not limited to expanding cropland and urban areas.***\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many factors that may cause dwindling species populations, such as climate change, plastic and chemical pollution, agricultural runoff, pesticides, erosion, hunting and poaching, spread of invasive species, and light and noise pollution, to name a few. Any and all of these may affect a nation's rate of endangered species, in addition to land cover issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "***The data only captures recent changes.***\n",
    "\n",
    "Some countries in the study may have very high proprotions of cropland, but if the land has had that cover ratio for hundreds of years, the ecosystem in the region may currently have balance, and counts of threatened species may be relatively low. However, this fact could be masking the real impact of high human land cover, as the harmful effects may have played out centuries ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "This might possibly cause some countries with high cropland cover to score better on species endangerment than countries who are in current process of heavy deforestation and conversion to cropland, but it does not mean that these countries have manged to sustain these high cropland proportions with no cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Counts of threatened species do not serve as a proxy for ecosystem health generally.***\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other metrics of the health of biodiversity and wildlife besides species endangerment rates. For instance, endangerment rates do not capture dwindling populations of species considered to be in the \"Least Concern\" category. Nor does it capture adaptations or migrations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ethical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Licensing and Use Restrictions of the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "All four datasets are available for public use with attribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Threatened Species - OECD: The OECD encourages public use of its own datasets, even for commercial use. [OECD Terms and Conditions](https://www.oecd.org/termsandconditions/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Red List Index - IUCN through UNDESA, OECD: The IUCN requires written permission for publication, redistribution, or other commercial uses of its work, but grants a free license to use for research or educational purposes. [IUCN Terms and Conditions](https://www.iucnredlist.org/terms/terms-of-use). \n",
    "\n",
    "- Land Cover - OECD and Copernicus/ESA: The ESA and Copernicus, like the OECD, grant free and open license to the public to use their work for any purpose, given attribution.

    "\n",
    "- Protected Areas - OECD and WDPA: The WDPA specifies restrictions on published and commercial work, but otherwise simply requires attribution. [WDPA Terms and Conditions](https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/legal)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Traceability and Anonymity\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is gathered by government organisations and NGOs, with well-documented processes. In this project, the OECD-supplied CSV files are read and samples of their contents shown before modifications. All modifications are explained and kept to their respective sections. Outputs of the dataframes are frequently used to expose the underlying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is not anonymised, but as it deals with nations rather than individuals, this does not violate individual privacy considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Biases of the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The Threatened Species dataset contains some potential bias, because it focuses on OECD countries, with several BRIICS countries included. This makes the dataset largely Europe-centric. The result of this is that there could potentially be a skew that masks useful global correlations in the statistics. This study endeavours to be very explicit about the consequences of this and to highlight the limitations throughout various points in the analysis, as well as the conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "### Ethical Nature of the Data and its Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to use the data to gain insights into a critical world problem. These datasets are used globally by researchers and policy makers to attempt to improve knowledge and gain insight into how to address the problem better. \n",
    "\n",
    "If analysis of these datasets were used to oversimplify or dismiss the problem, or to absolve certain countries of responsibility, this would likely be an ethical failing. However, proper treatment of the complexity of the situation and further research should lead to helpful gains in understanding, which is of benefit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations of Reusage of the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data in the project has not been collected independently as part of the project, and therefore no considerations need be given to its reuse. It is already publicly available and widely used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will use **Pandas** on top of **Numpy** to process the dataset CSV files into dataframe objects, and will make heavy use it to restructure, aggregate, and combine records and statistics for visualisations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualisations will be perfomed with **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**. \n",

    "### About the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The first dataset to explore is the OECD's [Threatened Species](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=WILD_LIFE) dataset. This dataset will be one of two that are used to look at the biodiversity strengths of different countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"Threatened\" is defined as an umbrella term encompassing the IUCN statuses of \"Vulnerable,\" \"Endangered,\" and \"Critically Endangered.\" This dataset contains species counts and percentages for each country for species that are Threatened, Vulnerable, Endangered, Critically Endangered, as well as counts for those that are Known.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset breaks species into categories such as mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds, and vascular plants. There is no aggregate data for total species in a country, in any IUCN category.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the data is supplied by the countries themselves, sometimes according to their own national classifications and data collection techniques, there may be inconsistencies in approach that could lead to different results, especially where prioritisation of incomplete data collection is concerned. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [OECD notes](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=WILD_LIFE) on the limitations of this dataset point out that many species groups are not fully assessed, and counting efforts for such groups may focus on species most likely to be threatened, which may create bias where the percentage of threatened species could be overestimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications for this Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset provides a means to calculate a key statistic for this project, namely, the percentage of threatened species within a country. This can be used to compare countries to each other, and later it can be used to look for correlations between species endangerment rates and land cover ratios across countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "To produce this statistic, it will be necessary to sum the raw counts of species within each category, both threatened and total known, and calculate the percentage from the summed values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "The aggregation of all at-risk IUCN categories into the single category of \"Threatened\" means that countries with similar overall percentages of threatened species will be viewed as on par with one another, even if one has a high proportion of \"Vulnerable\" species while another has a high proportion of \"Critically Endangered\" species. In other words, this metric may mask variations in severity of biodiversity status."

    "\n",
    "The second dataset to explore is the [Red List Index](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=RED_LIST) dataset. This dataset is the second of two that are used to look at the biodiversity strengths of different countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Red List Index is a more reliable and robust metric than the data in the Threatened Species dataset. It is not a collection of raw counts (which may be incomplete), but a calculated index based on changes in the weighted counts of species in different bands of IUCN Threatened status.[[1]] Its values range from 0 to 1, with 1 representing the notion that all of a country's species are of Least Concern, and 0 representing the notion that all species have gone extinct. In other words, it is a measure of the rate of biodiversity loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the IUCN status categories used in the previous dataset, the Red List Index communicates change over time. Past years' IUCN classifications of species were often erroneous due to poor data collection techniques, so changes between classes were often due to adjustments in accuracy.[[2]] The Red List Index, however, accounts for this, and so its values are are a more accurate representation of the changing status of countries over time. When the RLI is falling in a country over time, it means that the rate of extinctions or biodiversity loss is increasing, and vice versa.[[1]]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations and Ethics of the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it is a fairly reliable and trusted statistic, there are still many species groups that are under-counted or data deficient, and species counting challenges do still affect the RLI.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications for this Project\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the Threatened Species dataset, the Red List Index may be used as a single-value metric by which to compare countries in regards to the strength of the health of their wildlife, and to look for correlations with other behaviours such as land cover. Because it is based on more reliable data collection, however, it is likely a better statistic to use for these purposes. It can also be used to verify the results of the analysis of the Threatened Species data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second benefit is that the dataset contains historical data, with declining or rising rates over time indicating rising or declining rates of biodiversity loss. Therefore, the dataset can be used to plot trends over the last two decades, giving a deeper picture of the situation of biodiversity loss. This will also enable comparison to trends in changes in land cover over a similar period.\n",

    "### About the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Land Cover]((https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=LAND_COVER) dataset measures how countries' land mass is divided between types of land. This is determined by satellite imagery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type of land cover are called Land Cover Classes, and these fall into roughly two categories: natural and non-natural, although this distinction is not made in the dataset. The natural classes include Tree Cover, Grassland, Wetland, and Inland Water, among others. The non-natural classes are twofold: Cropland and Artificial Surfaces, which includes all urban areas and anything paved. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains two types of measure: square kilometers, and percentage of the total land mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "It contains values for particular past years, not annually: 1992, 2004, 2015, 2018, and 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this data is gathered from satellite imagery, it has good completion, although determination of bounderies is an issue that has some notes in the OECD listing of this database. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most severe limitation of this data is that while showing the extent of non-natural land cover does inform about where nature can **not** thrive, the inverse is not true. Reportage of natural land cover does not necessarily mean that nature can and does thrive there.[[1]] For one, the percentages of land cover in each class say nothing about how intact the land is, or whether it is continually bisected by roads or other infrastructures, or chequered by farms. For another, it does not comment on the quality of the land, whether it is rampant with invasive species, or pollution, or poachers, or other human activity. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications for this Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This study's main aims are to compare markers for biodiversity health to data on land cover ratios. Despite this dataset's limitations, its advantage is that it comes very close to painting a picture of the balance of human and wild division of the land, on a global scale, something which is not easy to do. This study seeks to investigate whether indeed this statistic can be shown to have a correlation with species endangerment rates across countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The land cover classes will need to be lumped into natural and non-natural types, although seeing a breakdown of each type would be interesting. \n",
    "\n",
    "The historic data will also be of interest, in particular to plot against the historic Red List Index data. There are gaps in the years, and the range is not exactly the same, but it mostly overlaps, and the trend can still be plotted.\n",

    "\n",
    "Protected Area can be designated as protected for conservational or ecological reasons, but also for cultural ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains percentage coverage of the total land area for each country. \n",

    "It contains annual data from 2021 back to 2000, before which data was recorded either every five or ten years, as far back as 1950.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Limitations of the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Protected land is subject to a similar limitation as the Land Cover dataset, in that land designated as Protected does not guarantee that it is land good for biodiversity or wildlife. While it has a much higher chance of being so, it is up to each country as to how to enforce the protected status of the land, and how to interpret it. Unfortunately, a very large portion of the world's Protected Areas have been found to in fact be under damaging pressures from human activity [[1]], [[2]]. \n",

    "### Applications for this Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The Protected Areas dataset provides a supplement to the Land Cover dataset as an alternative statistic that measures land use. It may account for some of the weaknesses or limitations of that dataset, or at least provide an additional perspective, when it comes to comparing land cover to biodiversity loss between countries.\n",

    "\n",
    "While this was not the most expected result, it can be seen that this investigation had severe limitations that could be masking an existing correlation. First, the sample set was small and limited mostly to European countries. These countries have had fewer intact wild ecosystems for centuries, and they may possess smaller total species counts, compared to other regions of the world. These facts could lead to relatively high RLI scores compared to land cover ratios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, as was noted in the [Land Cover section](#LC \"Jump to Land Cover section\"), natural land cover does not equate to intact or protected ecosystems. Natural land cover can, and typically is, cut into small pieces by cropland or infrastructure such as roads. This fact is masked in this comparison, with no discernable difference between countries with large intact natural habitats, and countries who have virtually no untouched lands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other considerations are that there are many other factors that affect the health of wildlife besides habitat encroachment and loss, and further, species loss might lag behind habitat contraction. Climate change, pollution, pesticide usage, invasive introduced species, hunting, and other damaging human behaviours also impact species populations. Given these, any correlation between land cover ratios and species endangerment rates might be quite wide, and only visible over a much wider sample set, or when controlled for other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is beyond the scope of this project to investigate these issues. However, one factor that can be looked at is the issue of protected land, which will be investigated below for [Question 3](#Q3 \"Jump to Question 3\")."

Indeed, much of the world's protected land is failing to protect nature, as humans continue to encroach upon it despite its status. [[1]]\n",

    "This project aimed to explore the data on threatened species and land cover among countries, and to compare a sample set of countries to one another. It also aimed to investigate whether there were any relationships in the data between species endangerment rates and either land cover ratios or designation of protected land.\n",
    "\n",
    "A clear relationship between these measurements was not found in the sample set. Neither Red List Index scores nor Threatened Species rates had a clear correlation with land cover ratios, either in a snapshot scatterplot of most recent year's data, or in trend data over recent decades, for the sample set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, while there may have been a slight correlation between Protected Areas data and Red List Index scores, the relationship was not clear, potentially due to a small sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is likely that a small sample set, which overrepresented a single region, made it difficult to see the relationship between these statistics clearly, and this is discussed in the section below. However, there is also a very real possibility that the statistics which have been gathered on land cover ratios and protected land are themselves problematic when used alone as indicators of pressures on wildlife. These statistics fail to differentiate the quality of the natural and protected land cover areas, which can range dramatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Land cover, for instance, initially seemed to be an excellent statistic for measuring the pressures on wildlife, or lack thereof, in a country. The OECD even states in its notes for this dataset that, \"Loss of natural and semi-natural vegetated land is presented as a proxy for pressures on biodiversity and ecosystems\".[[1]] However, the data for land cover ratios is taken from satellite imaging, and as such it lacks the ability to ascertain whether natural cover types possess intact or healthy ecosystems. In fact, this is a topic of newer research, as there currently is no very good way to measure the \"intactness\" of natural land. [[2]] The significance of this for reviewing country performance is that there is no real way to know whether two countries that are listed as having the same percentage of natural cover are anything like one another in terms of the quality of their natural ecosystems. In this study, this may explain in part why a correlation between land cover and Red List Index scores was so erratic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar issues exist for Protected Areas. While these land areas are more intentionally created than the natural land cover classes in the Land Cover database, they too can range in quality, and recent research has suggested that as much as a third of the world's protected land is in fact being heavily damaged by human activity.[[3]]\n",

    "\n",
    "### Potential Flaws in Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the problems identified above with the use of the land cover statistics, there were also several choices made in this study that may have undermined the aims of the analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The country sample size was too small for certain analyses.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A small sample size was chosen because it was of interest to this study to be able to view and compare the performance of individual countries, and this would have been impossible with a very large number of countries. Data visualisations would have become impossible to read or interpret. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was also chosen on the basis of one of the major datasets only including those countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it was useful and interesting in the Exploratory Data Analysis to be able to focus on a subset of countries and compare them, it was not a good choice for the investigation of the research questions. In searching for patterns and correlations in data, the bigger the sample, the better. In fact, using the entire population as the sample set would have been ideal, and more insights likely would have been gained.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The country sample set was not randomized, and it overrepresented a single region.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the differing ecological histories, levels of biodiversity, regional pressures, and policy approaches of countries globally, this small sample set from largely the same region was not an accurate representation of the world. As such, the comparative analysis of the research questions may have been quite inaccurate. The scatterplots, which did in fact use anonymised data, would have been much better performed on the full set of country data, or at least a more randomized sample. This would have prevented any potential pattern unique to the overrepresented region from skewing the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggestions for Further Research\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be interesting to do further research on this data with the full set of data for all countries. However, it would also be interesting to search for other statistics that may exist that might address the issue of land use balance more accurately. It is an area of developing research, as the issues inherent in using land cover or similar measures as a metric are known.\n",
